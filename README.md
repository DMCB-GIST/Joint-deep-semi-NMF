# JDSNMF: joint deep semi-non-negative matrixfactorization for learning integrativerepresentation of molecular signals onAlzheimerâ€™s disease


JDSNMF is a **joint deep semi-non-negative matrix factorization** that provides a hierarchical non-linear feature extraction approach for **multi-data**. <br/>
JDSNMF can capture **complex shared latent features from the complex multi-omics data**.<br/>
The model  can be applied a flexible integration for multiple data which does not require matching samples.
